##  The 'Relevance' intervention
There is evidence that gender stereotypes develop early, but little evidence on interventions that target this early development of stereotypes, and none that relate specifically to computing. This pilot intervention focuses on students in Year 8 and builds on evidence that linking learning to everyday life can help student engagement.

In the trial, you will use the 'Relevance' intervention, which aims to engage students in real-world issues to teach computing. Students will identify real-world issues which can be addressed by creating an app for a mobile device when, for instance, teachers may have introduced programming for programming's sake. Teachers are provided with resources that centre on teaching students computing by address a real-world issue.

For the 'Relevance' trial, students learn to program in [AppLab](https://code.org/educate/applab){:target="_blank"}, an age-appropriate, block-based programming tool where they will create their own app. App Lab is developed in JavaScript, offering students the opportunity to go on to text-based programming in the future.

Some students may have already programmed in a block-based programming such as [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu){:target="_blank"}. Block based programming environnments aid students' understanding of programming concepts because the programming environnment is visual. Students select and drag interlocking coloured blocks rather than type syntax-based code.

The 'Relevance' intervention introduces fundamental computing concepts. The trial focuses on two strands:
1. Identifying real-world issues which can be addressed with apps 
2. Programming an app in App Lab

**1. Identifying real-world issues addressed with apps** is a means of exploring computer programming by relating it to students' interests. Students develop their skills to:
+ Identify real-world issues
+ Review the content in relevant apps
+ Understand the potential of varied content in app design: images, video, text
+ Understand the importance of user interaction in app design
+ Identify an original idea for an app which addresses a real-world issue
+ Prepare a flowchart to map user interaction for the app as well as identify a sequence for their program
+ Prepare pseudocode to sketch out their program

**2. Programming an app in App Lab**. Students convert their idea by programming an app. They:
+ Organise code around programming constructs
+ Create sequence
+ Use repetition (iteration), if required
+ Use selection
+ Introduce input and output processes
+ Solve problems (debug) as the program develops

## Data collection using the online survey

In order to assess whether this intervention affects attitudes towards computing, pupils should complete our survey in advance of the first lesson (Lesson 1) and after the final lesson (Lesson 12).

The data collected for the trial will be pupils' attitudes to computing before and after implementing the 'Relevance' intervention for 12 weeks (or 12 hours of lessons). As outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding, your school should have sent out information letters to parents/carers to allow them to opt out of data collection on their child's behalf. The project guide also outlines how to explain the data collection to your pupils so that they can opt out if they do not wish their data to be collected. Any pupil who has opted out, by their own choice or by their parents'/carers' choice, should not complete the surveys described below. They will, however, take part in lessons as usual, and so will experience the intervention along with the rest of the class.
 
It is really important that both the pre- and post-surveys are completed, because this is how we will measure the effectiveness of the teaching approach. 

**MAY NEED TO CHANGE BELOW IN BOLD
Pupils will need to complete the pre- and post-surveys online. Each pupil will need to complete the survey individually, so they will need their own computer and/or tablet to work on. A link to the survey is given in the [Project guide](LINK) and also in the [Units overview](LINK).**

**You may need to take some time to read the questions out for pupils who have difficulty reading them independently, but please ensure that pupils answer them on their own, in their own words. Try not to lead pupils to a particular response while helping them to understand the questions.**

**Survey questions are answered with reference to a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = Strongly disagree to 4 = Strongly agree and are related to pupils' attitudes and engagement with computing.**

You will need to assign lesson time in Lesson 1 to complete the pre-survey. After at the end of the final lesson (Lesson 12), you will also need to allocate time to complete the post-survey.

At the end of the trial, we will ask you for your feedback and, in some cases, ask to conduct interviews.
 
You may also be contacted by our colleagues in the Behavioural Insights Team, who may wish to ask you some questions about participating in the trial, which is separate from the survey data. Please do respond to them to help us better understand your experience of the research programme.

## The Relevance trial

It is important to note that, while the research suggests that considering the 'relevance' of computing in addressing real-world problems may be particularly beneficial for increasing girlsâ€™ engagement, we expect that a wide range of pupils will benefit. When we talk about boys' and girls' attitudes to computing throughout this course, we are basing the discussion on research that has suggested differences on average between them. We recognise that this does not necessarily reflect all pupils' experiences of computing.

In the Relevance trial, we are asking one key question: 
+ Does linking computing lessons to real-world problems make computing more engaging to girls in Year 8?

Previous research in science has shown that high-school students were more interested and achieved better grades when they were encouraged to understand the practical applications of the subject and its relevance for their own lives [Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009](https://prlsamp.rcse.upr.edu/downloads/bestpractice2015/Harackiewicz_04.pdf).

## Part 1: Year 8 'Relevance' training – Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the Relevance project, part of the Gender Balance in Computing programme. In Part 1, you will be introduced to the Gender Balance in Computing programme and the Relevance project.

The online course is split into three parts. You can access the parts at different times, or complete the whole course at one time. You will be able to revisit the three parts until the end of the Relevance project. 
 
The 'Introduction to Relevance' webinar was based on the information in this session, Session 1. However, additional details are provided in this online training, so please do work through this session even if you attended the webinar.
 
If you did not attend the webinar, you can watch the recording or work your way through this session to ensure that you understand the background and emphasis of the project. The recording and slides have been sent to you via email, along with a document outlining key questions and answers from the session.

### Course content

Part 1 focuses on some of the research used as the basis for the project, so that you can better understand why introducing a real-world focus in your lesson could affect the gender balance in computing in your school. The Relevance project and the research behind it will be introduced, including why relating learning to addressing real-world problems ('relevance') is thought to be engaging for girls. You will also consider some of the practicalities of implementing 'relevance' in your classroom.

Parts 2 and 3 allow you time to explore the resources so that you are fully at ease with the content before the project begins. These parts of the online training course also include some hands-on development activities for you to complete in order to further your understanding of the resources and App Lab. The resources take a ‘learning-by-doing’ approach and thus require you to work through the materials as if you are a pupil. This will ensure you have the familiarity you need for you to be able to fully undertake the project. You will need to register your completion of the tasks, as they form part of your engagement in the project.

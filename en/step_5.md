## Why would girls benefit from making computing relevant to them?

The premise of the Relevance pilot trial is that the way in which computing is taught may not always match the ways in which girls prefer to learn, or their interests. It can often be seen as quite an abstract subject.

Previous research in science has shown that high-school students were more interested and achieved better grades when they were encouraged to understand the practical applications of the subject and its relevance for their own lives (Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009).

This focus on practicality and use of a subject can be seen in the computing qualifications that female pupils in the UK tend to choose. Female pupils are better represented in computing subjects that are viewed as more practical than computer science, such as those involving creative digital media (Kemp et al., 2017).

**Solving problems and achieving goals**
Part of being a ‘practical’ subject involves showing that computing can help to solve problems that are important to female pupils, and that it can help them to achieve their goals:
+ Research in the United States has suggested that female undergraduates are more likely to have goals related to helping others compared to male computing students, and that they do not always recognise the opportunities computer science affords to meet these goals (Lewis et al., 2019).
+ Increasing the relevance of computing to students’ lives has been shown to improve engagement of female undergraduates, producing a gender balance in the courses taken and resulting in improved retention of students over time (Guzdial & Tew, 2006).

This GBIC pilot study is the first research to focus on increasing relevance of computing through solving real world problems in secondary-aged pupils.

**Pause and reflect**
Do you notice differences in how interested female and male pupils are in computing? Have you noticed that female and male pupils use computers or computing lessons in different ways?
